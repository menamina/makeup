    I don't typically experiment with my makeup much these days since I what works for me. I know what concealers work well with my undertone, what lipstick shades look best, I know what blush/eyeshadow/bronzer is going to look too ghostly and never even <em>think</em> about purchasing them. Experimenting with makeup can be costly and also wasteful if a product does not work or if you have so much of one category that you never actually get use out of anything before it expires, which is why I stick to what I know works for me.<br>
    However, recently I have been wanting to experiment with blush again. At one point in time I owned over 10+ blushes, which was way too many for me, and before my recent spree I had 2 - one being a lipstick I used as blush.

        When I was in college I wore yellow eyeshadow as blush and enjoyed the color on my skintone but, because the quality of the yellow was patchy and hard to blend I didn't bother fussing with it.<br>
        The season is currently summer and I was thinking how nice it would be to have a yellow or even orange blush, not like a terracotta color that I always wear - but a true orange.<br>
        Halsey has a makeup line, about-face, which I have seen in Ulta plenty of times. They have cream blushes I have always admired from afar but never got due to me wanting to consume less.<br>
        They also have liquid eyeshadow sticks that come in a wide range of color. They had a sell recently so I decided why not try out the eyeshadow sticks as a blush and also get the blush I have been eyeing for over a year.<br>
        I have this rule where if I want to buy something that is not a need I will think it over at least a week and see how I feel about it. If I still want it and it won't break the bank I will get it. If I no longer want it, I won't.<br>
        This mentality thankfully stopped my makeup shopping addiction from spiraling into thousands of dollars in cosmetic debt. And I think it is safe to assume that me thinking about this blush on and off for over a year has definitely fit this rule lol!<br>
