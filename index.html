    <div class="center"><h4><em>About</em></h4></div>
    <p>These days I am not as deep into makeup as I once was when I was 16. 
        And while I no longer know about the latest makeup releases or browse Ulta + Sephora at least once a week, I do still regularly wear and enjoy makeup.<br>
        I enjoy it so much that I created <em>this</em> blog dedicated to it, well.. cosmetics in general, with a focus on makeup!
    </p>

    <h4>Intentions</h4>
    <p>
        I am someone who enjoys an aesthetic physical environment such as my curated room, but also an aesthetically pleasing website.<br>
     <a href="https://theordinary.com/" rel="noreferrer">The Ordinary</a>, <a href="https://www.seintofficial.com/" rel="noreferrer">Seint's</a>, and <a href="https://patternbeauty.com/" rel="noreferrer">Pattern Beauty</a> are just a few cosmetic sites I think are beautifully made.
