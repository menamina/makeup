            <div class="subblurb">kelly gooch.</div>
            <div class="subblurb1">
                i've been watching kelly since i was maybe 20 years old and 
                although we are on opposite sides of a foundation shade range, 
                i enjoy her content (as well as others who do not look like me)
                for different a variety of reasons.<br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="subblurb2">
                first of all, i like to do my makeup in a similar way to her. 
                i love warm tones, i love a more "natural"/your face but better look.
                and kelly definitely also uses similar shades. so typically eyeshadow or 
                lip products she recommends i can try as well. and since brands are more inclusive 
                these days (prior to 2018 ish it was not that great... mind you fenty released in 2017 
                and i believe that THAT is what truly set the stage for all the progress we have seen now.) 
                now, whenever a fair skin content creator reccomends a product i can usually find 
                that that product line also has a shade for me emphasis on usually. whereas in 2016.. that was not the 
                case.. <br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="blurb4">
                another reason i enjoy her videos is because she does a lot of affordable makeup reviews which
                as someone who typically buys drugstore products i love that. now i am willing to spend more money 
                on something that i know i wont go through as quickly, if i've thought about it, and if it makes sense. 
                for examplea blush or bronzer or eyeshadow pallet. i do not go through blush as quickly as i do concealer,  setting spray, or lip products
                so to me spending $30+ on one blush or one bronzer is not going to break the bank. 
                i definitely believe in beauty on a budget and just because a product is more expensive does not mean that 
                1: you're going to be better at doing makeup and 2: that it is any better than a drugstore product. to me makeup 
                really comes down to technique, it does not matter if your product is $50 or $5. what matters is the quality of 
                that product which can be it or miss irregardless of price and your application technique.<br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="blurb5">
                my last reason i enjoy her is because she is a conscious consumer/anti consumer which feeds into what i was saying
                earlier. which is i cannot stand when i watch a video and it feels not like a genuine review, like im just being 
                marketed to. when i feel like that i feel like the product review is less genuine for some reason. i guess i just 
                miss the days where youtube was what it was before people were only making videos for the sake of money. - is a side 
                tangent because im thinking about it as im writing it but another thing that turns me off from watching someoone is when
                in the first 5 seconds of their video they say to subscribe and comment and whateverlike.. i havent even gotten a chance 
                yet to know if i like your vibe/conent and i dont need to be told to subscribe or comment. if i like you enough 
                i will - if not i wont. if i have something to say i will - if not i wont. i dont know am i ... bitter? LOL

            <div class="c4name">ourielle.</div>
            <div class="c4blurb1">ourielle's content no longer is centered around makeup
            but honestly, i could care less what kind of content she makes - i'ma still watch her.
            i watched her for a good while when she was a makeup only channel but because i really enjoy
            her calm personality i like to have her on in the background while i do things and sometimes
            i rewatch her vidoes just in general just as a way to decompress. i hope you have a comfort 
            youtuber too like that :&#41; <br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="c4blurb2">
            i don't do knitting or crochetting, the closest i got to that was embroidery in high school
            which i throughoughly enjoyed. i do enjoy oil pastels and gouche from time to time.
            im so blessed to have had the resources in my school that i had
            growing up; i know a lot of schools do not have what i had growing up. as a side tangent,
            i wish the government had the mind to enrich each and every school's with similar classes/clubs i had available to me.
            or even just having more OPTIONS for children to express. <br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="c5blurb">
            i could go on a long tangent about children, and how enrichening their lives with opportunity
            and equity can improve their quality of life. we must give children the tools they need to grow and
            expand to their potential!! anyways, i digress.. i'm not sure if she still is, but ourielle was (or still is) a teacher as well.
            and i would be sure that she shares that same passion within her. <br><br>
            </div>

            <div class="c6blurb">
                she is such a talented knitter! i dont watch anyone else who knits as this is not something
                that im interested in as a creative hobby myself but i have to say i am so impressed by her work.
                i also am impressed by her because she also had a press on nail business at one point in time.
                and those designs were AMAZING. they were not my type of design so i never got anything from her shop
                but again, the creativity was to be applauded. she truly is an ace. i also just love her style, shes so julia!
                at least my version of julia.
