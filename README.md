i wanted to create a personal webpage alongside the odin project to showcase my html/css + flexbox skills
as well as anything else i will be learning along the journey
my goal is:
as i learn more integrate what i am learning through the practices here.
this site is not necessarily for knowledge or content creation
it is stricly to showcase my skills through the creation of a faux cosmetics blog
i am not entirely sure what i want on here but i had this idea and i find it to be fun!
